## MVC Crud Project (11/2017)
##By Chris Gehrke

The project was to make a functional website where we could create, read, update, and delete an object.

The technologies that I used for this project was Spring MVC, CSS, and bootstrap.


My website is the top 10 wines on google shopping.

*To use my website all you have to do is click on a link to view the wines name, bottle size, its alcohol by volume, and its price.

*You can also look up a wine by number in the list.

*If you want you can update or delete a wine.

*You may also add your own wine to the list.

In the future I would like to improve my CSS and make everything work better.
I would also like to implement a shopping cart and a total so its more that you can order wine instead of just looking at a list of wine.

I stumbled a lot with getting my program to work with the CSS and adding images to individual wines. I need to practice more with styling so I dont sit there beating my head trying to get things to work well with eachother.
